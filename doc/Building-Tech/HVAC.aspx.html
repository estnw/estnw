<p>Heat flows naturally from a warmer to a cooler space. In winter, the heat moves 
  directly from all heated living spaces to the outdoors and to adjacent unheated 
  attics, garages, and basements - wherever there is a difference in temperature. 
  During the summer, heat moves from outdoors to the house interior. To maintain 
  comfort, the heat lost in winter must be replaced by your heating system and 
  the heat gained in summer must be removed by your air conditioner.</p>
<p>Heating and cooling account for 50 to 70% of the energy used in the average 
  American home. Inadequate insulation and air leakage are leading causes of energy 
  waste in most homes. To read more about how Quail insulate, please <a href="Insulation.aspx.html">click 
  here</a>.</p>
<p>High-efficiency furnaces, in conjunction with a well built house and thermal 
  envelope (sealed and insulated ducts), can reduce heating and energy consumption. 
  At Quail Homes, we use open web floor trusses to enable us to install ducting 
  inside conditioned space. All the ducting are sealed, tested and certified to 
  Earth Advantage standard.

</p><p> For heating and cooling, Quail Homes installs Bryant hybrid heat system 
    using a heat pump with a high efficient gas furnace with 93% efficiency as our 
    standard. The furnace is also located inside the condition space in the house.

Quail High Performance Detail drawing. </p> 
<p>There are two types of heat pump: air source and geothermal. </p>
<p><u><b>Air-source heat pumps</b></u> can provide efficient heating and cooling 
  for your home, especially if you live in a warm climate. When properly installed, 
  an air-source heat pump can deliver one-and-a-half to three times more heat 
  energy to a home than the electrical energy it consumes. This is possible because 
  a heat pump moves heat rather than converting it from a fuel, like in combustion 
  heating systems. </p>
<p>Although air-source heat pumps can be used in nearly all parts of the United 
  States, they do not generally perform well over extended periods of sub-freezing 
  temperatures. In regions with sub-freezing winter temperatures, it may not be 
  cost effective to meet all your heating needs with a standard air-source heat 
  pump.</p>
<p>However, new systems with gas heating as a backup are able to overcome this 
  problem. There is also a "Cold Climate Heat Pump" which shows promise, but is 
  currently facing manufacturing problems. In addition, a version called the "Reverse 
  Cycle Chiller" claims to be able to operate efficiently at below-freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="images/Geothermal-heatpump.jpg" alt="Geothermal System" width="313" height="235
" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /> 
<p><u><b>Geothermal heat pumps</b></u>&nbsp; (sometimes referred to as GeoExchange, 
  earth-coupled, ground-source, or water-source heat pumps) have been in use since 
  the late 1940s. Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) use the constant temperature of 
  the earth as the exchange medium instead of the outside air temperature. This 
  allows the system to reach fairly high efficiencies (300%-600%) on the coldest 
  of winter nights, compared to 175%-250% for air-source heat pumps on cool days. 
  While many parts of the country experience seasonal temperature extremes—from 
  scorching heat in the summer to sub-zero cold in the winter—a few feet below 
  the earth's surface the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. 
  Depending on latitude, ground temperatures range from 45°F (7°C) to 75°F 
  (21°C). Like a cave, this ground temperature is warmer than the air above it 
  during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. The GHP takes advantage 
  of this by exchanging heat with the earth through a ground heat exchanger. As 
  with any heat pump, geothermal and water-source heat pumps are able to heat, 
  cool, and, if so equipped, supply the house with hot water. Some models of geothermal 
  systems are available with two-speed compressors and variable fans for more 
  comfort and energy savings. Relative to air-source heat pumps, they are quieter, 
  last longer, need little maintenance, and do not depend on the temperature of 
  the outside air. A dual-source heat pump combines an air-source heat pump with 
  a geothermal heat pump. These appliances combine the best of both systems. Dual-source 
  heat pumps have higher efficiency ratings than air-source units, but are not 
  as efficient as geothermal units. The main advantage of dual-source systems 
  is that they cost much less to install than a single geothermal unit, and work 
  almost as well. Even though the installation price of a geothermal system can 
  be several times that of an air-source system of the same heating and cooling 
  capacity, the additional costs are returned to you in energy savings in 5–10 
  years. System life is estimated at 25 years for the inside components and 50+ 
  years for the ground loop. There are approximately 50,000 geothermal heat pumps 
  installed in the United States each year.We highly recommend geothermal 
heat pump, when the property size permits. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
 <img src="images/Tankless-waterheater.jpg" alt="Tankless water heater" width="174" height="230" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" /> 
<p><a href="http://www.rinnai.us/images/HowItWorks_01.swf" title="Quail Homes uses Rinnai tankless water heater">Tankless Water Heater</a>&nbsp; is standard equipment at Quail Homes. 
  A tankless water heater has an oversized burner heats water flowing continuously 
  through the unit. Depending on the capacity of the burner and the volume of 
  water running through the unit, tankless water heaters can produce a constant 
  volume of heated water.</p>
<p>Although the burners of tank and tankless heaters are of comparable efficiency, 
  eliminating the tank of stored water and operating the heater only when there 
  is a demand for hot water significantly increases the annualized efficiency 
  of the heater. In general, conversion to a tankless heater will lower water 
  heating energy use by at least 20 percent. Replacing a 20-year-old model with 
  a new tankless one will likely result in savings of 30 percent or more.</p>
<p>Another advantage of eliminating the tank is space savings. A tankless water 
  heater uses much less space than a tank-style heater, and many models can be 
  installed on an exterior wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Windows</u></b>&nbsp; play a critical role in creating sustainable and 
  high-performance housing. In addition to specifying the right windows to enable 
  more glass without boosting your heating bill, work to get the most out of each 
  window opportunity. Operable windows can be good for crossing ventilation, mitigating 
  the need for cooling energy and mechanical ventilation on summer evenings.<img src="images/windows.jpg" alt="Windows" align="right" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" /></p>
<p>Windows should be selected to manage the quantity of heat loss and solar gain. 
  In a cloudy, heating-dominated marine climate, like ours, it is preferable to 
  use windows with a lower U-factor and a higher Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC). 
  The U-factor is a measure of heat transfer. The lower the U-factor the better 
  the window performs at stopping heat flow. The SHGC measures how well the window 
  blocks heat caused by sunlight. The lower the rating the less solar heat the 
  window transmits. The IECC, International Energy Conservation Code, requires 
  a window U-value of 0.35 or lower in the marine climate; no SHGC is specified. 
</p>
<p>At Quail Homes, we install only .30 U-Value or better vinyl windows.</p>
