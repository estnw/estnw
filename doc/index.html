  <h2>Green Building Helps Developer Thrive Despite Great Recession</h2> 
        <i>By Claudia Girrbach 
        <br />
        </i> 
        <p> With homebuyers frozen out of the market in the winter '08, Jon Girod, 
          the co-founder and president of Quail Homes, took a hard look at his 
          business model. He made the bold decision to embrace green building 
          practices. This case study reviews why he decided to retrench, how he 
          shifted to green and the results. </p>
        <b>The Turning Point</b><br />
       
        <p>Girod had been a successful homebuilder for over 20 years in the Vancouver, 
          Wash. - Portland, Ore. region. "As the severity of the economic downturn 
          became apparent, Girod did not know what to do at first. He soon concluded 
          that the same entrepreneurial mindset that served him in the early days 
          of his business would help him survive and eventually thrive.<br />
          <br />
          Prior to the downturn, Girod had been aware of green building practices 
          and Quail Homes incorporated some of the concepts. He found green principles 
          fit his values of quality and thrift; the idea of building smarter made 
          sense. But when his sales were strong, he had not had the time to make 
          the shift.<br />
          <br />
          After he made the decision to "embrace green," he realized that the 
          market downturn provided him the opportunity needed to make the change. 
          He also saw that green would provide a valued differentiator from other 
          new homes and used homes that were flooding the market.<br />
          <br />
          The crisis also made Girod consider his long-term legacy. In the course 
          of his career he would likely build over 3,000 homes. He wanted to do 
          his part to offer better performing homes that provided greater efficiency 
          and more comfortable living. </p>
        <b>The Challenges of Converting a Construction Team</b> <br />
      
        <p><a href="http://ads.columbian.com/mobile/landing_pages/quail_homes/splash/"><img src="images/AskQuailHomes.jpg" alt="Ask the Builder - Quail Homes" align="left" 
                hspace="20" vspace="10" width="300" height="250" /></a>Although Girod was convinced that "green was not a fad and had staying 
          power," his crew and subcontractors were less enthusiastic. Some were 
          vocal naysayers. They worried that new practices would take longer and 
          cost more, which seemed like a poor prescription to the economic woes. 
          But Girod was not discouraged. "You are not a leader until you need 
          to move people to a different path," he said.<br />
          <br />
          Rather than try to over-sell his point of view, Girod listened to his 
          team and did not discount their apprehensions. In fact, he paid for 
          the extra time required to learn new techniques. He considered this 
          his R&D investment. <br /><br />In subsequent jobs, Girod expected that his team 
          and subcontractors were smart enough to figure out how to make the green 
          technique more efficient and paid the standard rates. <br /><br />To facilitate 
          the shift, Girod and his team did a bit of experimentation to find the 
          best approaches. He worked closely with his employees and subcontractors 
          to help them optimize and cheer them on. "You can get real resourceful 
          when you don't have much money," he explained. <br /><br />A big lesson was to fully 
          commit to the new method -- a "burn the bridge" mentality. In Girod's 
          experience, it is not until people are fully committed do they truly 
          open up to new ways and make them efficient. With a foot in both worlds, 
          new methods often languish because they are never given full attention, 
          or are purposefully sabotaged. Many a big company CEO could vouch for 
          that. <br /><br />Over time, veteran construction workers became Girod's biggest 
          advocates -- selling green to new recruits. One framer started building 
          his own home using conventional methods at the start of Quail Homes' 
          conversion to green. Upon completion of the home, Girod described "that 
          the framer was kicking himself for not building green" given its advantages 
          and comparable cost. </p>
        <b>Winning Over Customers</b><br />

<p><img width="300" height="225" src="images/QuailHomes.jpg" align="right" 
                hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Quail Custom Green Homes Builder in Portland/Vancouver" />Once Quail Homes had built their new green homes, the next step was selling them. Girod found that his potential customers appreciated energy efficiency, greater performance, more comfortable living such as air quality, noise dampening and consistent temperatures.<br /><br />
Girod believes that the confusion among consumers is "in the details of how green is delivered." Given consumer interest in green values, many builders claim to be green.<br /><br />
Girod favors an industry standard to eliminate consumer confusion. Quail Homes uses Home Energy Rating System (HERS) to measure its homes' efficiency. HERS is a relative energy use index that estimates the energy use of the building. A HERS index of 100 represents the energy use of "American Standard Building" and zero represents that no net purchased energy is required.<br /><br />
Despite the optimization of building methods, there is still a small cost premium given materials such as more insulation or higher quality windows. These extra costs are easily offset by lower energy costs in the long run. Girod tackles this sales challenge in a pragmatic way. "You just need to focus the buyer to sell it," he said. "Green features are worth much more than a granite counter top which was once the must-have feature."<br /><br />
In addition to his one-on-one sales efforts, Girod does a good job on his website to educate consumers and dispel the myths surrounding green building practices.</p>

<b>Making Green a Core Value</b><br /><br />
        <p>Quail Homes has made the transition to green and its green inventory has solid turnover. Girod continues to look for ways to incorporate more efficiency measures. Homebuyers are realizing at least as much energy savings as estimated by HERS. "Once a construction team learns that green is not that hard and once homeowners experience living in a green home, they never go back," Girod said.</p>
